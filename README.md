# Hi, I'm Yunus 👋

Computer Engineering student focusing on **Python-based automation**,  
**data processing tools**, and **Android mini utility applications**.

I enjoy building lightweight, practical tools and exploring  
AI-assisted development workflows — especially in areas where  
software, data, and real-time processing come together.

## 🧩 Tech Focus

**Primary:**  
Python (automation, data processing, file operations, tooling etc.)

**Secondary:**  
Android (Java) – mini utility apps, simple UI-driven applications

**Foundational:**  
FastAPI (basic backend), C, C++, Arduino, OCR/ASR (research-level exposure)

**Exploratory:**  
Signal processing, embedded systems, advanced sensing architectures

## 🔭 Long-Term Direction

In the long run, I aim to move toward systems that bring together  
software, signal processing, and embedded technology — focusing on  
future human–technology interfaces and sensing systems.

I'm currently building the foundations for this direction while  
developing practical tools and applied projects.

## 🚀 Current Work

- Developing a privacy-focused multimodal detection system  
  (university-backed research; details intentionally minimized)

- Creating Python automation & data transformation tools  
  (PDF/CSV/Excel utilities, converters, small processing scripts)

- Building Android utility applications  
  (GPS tools, CRUD apps, small feature-focused apps)
