# Hi, I'm Yunus 👋

Computer Engineering student currently working on **Python-based automation**,  
**data processing tools**, and **Android mini utility applications**.

I enjoy building lightweight, practical tools — especially in areas where  
software, data, and real-time processing intersect.

## 🧩 Tech Focus

**Primary**  
Python (automation, data processing, file handling, small tooling)

**Secondary**  
Android (Java) – mini utility apps, simple UI-driven applications

**Foundational**  
FastAPI (basic backend), C, C++, Arduino, OCR/ASR (research exposure)

**Exploratory**  
Signal processing, embedded systems, advanced sensing architectures

## 🔭 Long-Term Direction

I’m gradually moving toward systems that integrate software,  
signal processing, and embedded technology — with an interest in  
next-generation human–technology interfaces and sensing systems.

My current projects are building the early foundations for this track.

## 🚀 Current Work

- A privacy-oriented multimodal detection system  
  (university-backed; details intentionally minimized)

- Python automation and data-processing tools  
  (Excel/CSV/PDF utilities, format converters, processing scripts)

- Android mini applications  
  (GPS utilities, CRUD tools, small feature-focused apps)

---

## 📅 Portfolio Direction (2025)

Actively working on:

- Publishing Python automation tools  
- Expanding small, practical utility apps  
- Organizing ongoing research work more cleanly  
- Improving documentation and reproducibility  
- Moving gradually toward embedded/signal-centric projects
